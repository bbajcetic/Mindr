# mindr

mindr is a cross-platform emotion monitoring app, essential for every
smart home. The app is tailored to provide an unintrusive and private
solution to keep track of a child's well-being during all those times you
can't be with them.

## How it works

The emotion monitoring happens locally on a laptop or any Internet of Things device
that supports a camera. Each frame from the camera is processed
for emotional content and severe emotional distress. The emotion
processing is facilitated using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and was trained
using a convolutional neural network within TFLearn. All of the image
data is stored locally, to protect a parent's privacy.

The emotional data is then sent to a Django backend web-server where it
is parsed into a PostgreSQL database. The Django web-server then serves
analytical data to a React/Redux single-page web app. This web app provides
parents with a clean interface for tracking their child's emotional
behavior throughout time. Distressing emotional events are expedited to the
parent by sending notifications through SMS or email.

## nwHacks 2018

This app was built at the nwHacks 2018 hackathon over 24 hours. It
received positive feedback from judges which resulted in the following:

+ placing 9th out of 114 hacks
+ winning the RBC Royal Bank award for "Best real, or near real-time
  streaming application"
+ winning the Wolfram|Alpha award "The Wolfram Award"
